## Primary Source

JAVASCRIPT: The Comprehensive Guide  
Author: Philip Ackermann

This book served as the main foundational reference for this project.
Most core concepts, topic ordering, explanations, and overall structure were inspired by or derived from this source.
It was also used as a primary benchmark to ensure correctness, completeness, and proper coverage of JavaScript fundamentals and advanced topics.

---

## Video Courses (YouTube)

Various JavaScript courses and tutorials available on YouTube were consulted.
These resources helped reinforce understanding, provide alternative explanations, and demonstrate practical usage.
Ideas taken from these courses were researched and aligned with the primary book reference to maintain accuracy and consistency.

---

## Online Educational Resources

Additional information was gathered from different sources on the internet, including:
- Educational websites
- Official documentation
- Programming forums and discussions

These sources were used selectively to:
- Clarify specific behaviors or edge cases
- Verify important observations about certain topics
- Supplement explanations when deeper insight was required

Online resources were not the primary source and were used only after careful evaluation.

## Artificial Intelligence Assistance

Artificial intelligence tools were used as a supportive aid, not as an authoritative source.
They were utilized to:
- Identify missing details or overlooked topics
- Generate accurate and detailed examples
- Create summaries, comparison tables, and structured explanations
- Develop additional ideas, challenges, and exercises

All AI-assisted content was reviewed and refined to align with established JavaScript standards and the primary reference material.
