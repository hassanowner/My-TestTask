# FAQ – Frequently Asked Questions

This file answers common questions about how to study and use this JavaScript tutorial program effectively.

---

## How should I study this JavaScript course?

You should start by following the course structure exactly as it is organized in the repository.

Begin with the **first folder and first topic**, then move forward step by step.  
Each folder represents a specific topic or concept in JavaScript, and the order is intentional.

Do not skip topics. JavaScript concepts build on each other, and skipping fundamentals will make advanced topics harder to understand.

---

## What is the recommended learning process for each topic?

For each topic, follow this process:

1. **Read and understand the explanation**
   - Carefully read the lesson files.
   - Make sure you understand the concept, syntax, and purpose of the topic.

2. **Study the examples**
   - Go through the provided examples line by line.
   - Understand why each line of code exists and what it does.

3. **Create a practical application**
   - Write your own code manually.
   - Even if your code looks similar to the example, write it yourself from scratch.
   - Do not copy and paste.

Writing code manually strengthens your understanding and helps you develop real programming skills.

---

## Why should I rewrite code even if it is similar to the example?

Rewriting code manually helps you:
- Improve muscle memory
- Understand syntax deeply
- Learn how to debug mistakes
- Think like a programmer

This habit is essential if you want to become a professional JavaScript developer.

---

## Are there real-world examples in this course?

Yes.

You will encounter **real-world scenarios and use cases** throughout the course.
These examples help you understand:
- How JavaScript is used in real applications
- How to solve practical problems
- How to think logically and analytically

Each topic aims to connect theory with real usage.

---

## What is the Practice or Challenge section?

After completing each topic, you will find a **Practice** or **Challenge** section.

In this section, you should:
- Solve problems related to the topic
- Apply what you learned without looking at the solution
- Experiment with different approaches

These challenges are designed to:
- Reinforce your understanding
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Show practical applications of JavaScript concepts

---

## What kind of challenges should I focus on?

Try to work on challenges that:
- Simulate real-world problems
- Use multiple methods and features together
- Require logical thinking, not memorization
- Encourage clean and readable code

Each challenge may have multiple solutions. Exploring different solutions will improve your skills significantly.

---

## What is the Extensions section?

After finishing a topic, always check the **Extensions** section (if available).

The Extensions section includes:
- Additional related concepts
- Advanced usage
- Optional tools and features
- Deeper insights into the topic

Studying extensions ensures that you:
- Fully understand the subject
- Are aware of related tools and techniques
- Do not miss important details

---

## Can I use Google or AI while studying?

Yes. In the modern age, using external tools is encouraged.

You can use:
- Google
- Official documentation
- Artificial Intelligence tools

AI can help you:
- Search for topics you don’t understand
- Get step-by-step explanations
- Simplify complex ideas
- Provide additional examples and clarifications

However, always make sure you **understand** the output and do not rely on tools without learning.

---

## Are there additional resources I can use?

Yes. If you want to go deeper, you can benefit from the following books:

- *JAVASCRIPT: The Comprehensive Guide* — Philip Ackermann  
- *JavaScript: The Definitive Guide* — David Flanagan  
- *You Don’t Know JS Yet* (Series) — Kyle Simpson  

These books provide strong theoretical foundations and deep insights into how JavaScript works.

---

## Final advice

Consistency is more important than speed.  
Practice regularly, write code daily, and challenge yourself.

By following this structure and mindset, you will gain a strong, practical, and professional understanding of JavaScript.
